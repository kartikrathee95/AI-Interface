### What is it?

This tool allows you to summarize any website by simply providing a link. The tool uses the Beautiful Soup and OpenAI libraries to scrape the website and generate a summary.


The tool works by first scraping the website using Beautiful Soup to extract the main content. The extracted content is then passed to the OpenAI GPT-3 language model, which generates a summary of the website. The summary is then returned to the user.

### Setup


Refer to this [setup video]() to install the dependencies and generate OpenAI keys and incorporate with our applications. Make sure you've changed the API keys in `pass.yml` file, else it'll raise error `openai.error.AuthenticationError: Incorrect API key provided`. I've articulated the steps in text format here : 

- start this repository
- Install the dependencies of this repository 
- Paste your OpenAI API keys in `pass.yml` file
- parse from command line (Attributes : `web` `limit`)
