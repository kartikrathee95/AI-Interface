### What is it?

The GitHub repository titled "ChatGPT Python Applications" is a comprehensive collection of Python applications built around the ChatGPT language model. This repository contains multiple standalone applications, each demonstrating different use cases and applications of the ChatGPT model.

The applications in this repository are designed to showcase the versatility and power of ChatGPT in various contexts, from simple chatbots to more advanced natural language processing applications. Each application is well documented, providing a clear understanding of its functionality, how it works, and how it can be integrated into other projects. All applications are written in Python, with a clear structure and code that is easy to understand and modify. The repository is also open-source, so users can contribute to the project, submit bug reports, and suggest improvements.

Overall, the "ChatGPT Python Applications" repository is a valuable resource for developers looking to integrate ChatGPT into their projects or explore the potential of natural language processing with Python.

### Setup 

Refer to this [setup video](https://youtu.be/beEBeQw5tpc) to install the dependencies and generate OpenAI keys and incorporate with our applications. I've articulated the steps in text format here : 

- Star this repository (top-right corner)
- Install the dependencies following these steps : 

  - Star this repository (top right corner) 
  - <>Code > Download ZIP > Open cmd/terminal in that location
  - Run this command : `pip install -r requirements.txt`

- Paste your OpenAI API keys in `pass.yml` file

- To clone the repository use this code in command line 
```
git clone https://github.com/xiaowuc2/ChatGPT-Python-Applications
```
